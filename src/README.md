# SRC code for Demographic Migration Data Analysis 
Contains the MigrationData file and class. This has the necessary data processing elements to process the data from the ./data/migration_data (census migration data). 
Formatting and the general processes are explained in the docstrings, as well as examples in the MigrationData.py file.

### Minor Notes
Percentages
- The percentages represent the percentage of people of the subdemographic who moved state to state for the getter methods. For example,
 0.2 percentage age 1-17 for California would mean that 0.2 percentage of the total 1 to 17 pop in Ca actually moved from another state to Ca in the last year.
